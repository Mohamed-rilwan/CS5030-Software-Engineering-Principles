Content

- Good overview of the system.
- Significant features are summarised well.
- Interesting discussion of software engineering processes.
- Some relevant information on the business model.
- A couple of ethical concerns are briefly identified.
- Plans and improvements for future based on information from your sources are provided. In addition to these, can you think of any that you'd like to see?

Reflection & discussion

- You have gathered information from multiple sources and synthesised some useful insights.
- Claims are backed up by citations.
- A particularly high number of references, which is good.
- A slight lack of reflection and original discussion.  The report summarises information from your sources well, but I'd love to see more conclusions drawn from them.

Report

- Good structure overall but the later sections need to be organised better.
- Numbered sections might make the report easier to navigate.
- Report is generally written well, although there are a few minor language issues.
- Bibliography of appropriate references, well formatted.

Summary

- Good attempt at the report addressing all required aspects in good writing style without major problems, including lots of your own research, good understanding of software engineering concerns in the context of the chosen system, perhaps with a lack of critical and original thinking.
